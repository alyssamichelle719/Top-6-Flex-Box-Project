      <h3>Demon Slayer</h3>
      
      <p>
        When Tanjiro Kamado comes home one day he finds his family was slaughtered. The cause? Demons. When greiving, he notices a trail of blood leading out of the house and discovers his younger sister, Nezuko, is still alive - but turned into a demon. He struggles to take her under his wing but firmly believes that his sister is still in there. He vows to somehow, find a cure for his sister to turn her back into a human.
      </p>
      
      <p>Tanjiro decides that he will not let something like this happen to anybody else and decides to try to join the Demon Slayer Corps - an elite group of demon hunters. There he meets Zenitsu and Inosuke and together the three of them work together to rid demons.</p>

      <p>Trouble arises though when the leader of the Demons realizes that Nezuko is alive, but not under his rule. Even worse, he's made aware of Tanjiro's bonus power inherited from his father - and he wants it.</p>

      <p>Demon Slayer is available on all streaming platforms like Crunchyroll, Netflix, Hulu, and Funimation.</p>

      <p>There is also a movie available to watch - Demon Slayer: Mungeun Train.</p>
