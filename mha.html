      <h3>My Hero Academia</h3>

      <p>Izuku Midoriya is a boy who wishes to become a hero just like his idol, All Might, however lacking a Quirk makes the dream feel impossible, and makes him an easy target for bullying, like from his childhood friend, Katsuki Bakugo. However, after an incident where Izuku meets All Might, he proves himself worthy of becoming a hero, and is chosen as All Might's successor to inherit his Quirk, One For All, which allows him to get accepted to U.A. High School, and learn how to become a true hero.</p>
      <p>After enrolling at U.A High School, Midoriya joins class 1-A, lead by Shota Izawa aka Eraser Head. He makes friends with all of his classmates, including his childhood friend and bully Katsuki Bakugo. He learns how to be the best hero he can be with the help of his friends and All Might.</p>

      <p>The first year heros have to overcome many challenges, including countless villain attacks that lead them to having to become pro heroes sooner than they may think.</p>

      <p>My Hero Academia is currently airing its 6th season on Funimation, Crunchyroll, and Hulu. The other 5 seasons, as well as all three movies, are available to stream as well.</p>
