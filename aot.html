      <h3>Attack On Titan</h3>
      
     <p>When man-eating Titans first appeared 100 years ago, humans found safety behind massive walls that stopped the giants in their tracks. </p>
       
       <p>But the safety they have had for so long is threatened when a colossal Titan smashes through the barriers, causing a flood of the giants into what had been the humans' safe zone. </p>
      
      <p>During the carnage that follows, soldier Eren Jaeger sees one of the creatures devour his mother, which leads him to vow that he will kill every Titan. He enlists some friends who survived to help him, and that group is humanity's last hope for avoiding extinction at the hands of the monsters. </p>

      <p>But not everything is as it seems. When its discovered that Eren himself is able to turn into a Titan, and find that their closest comrades have betrayed them, what will come of the Scouts?</p>

      <p>And what happens when Eren turns their back on all of them in the show's ending?</p>

      <p>You can watch Attack on Titan on various streaming platforms such as Crunchyroll, Funimation, and Hulu!</p>

      <p>The series finale will air in December 2022.</p>
