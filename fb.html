      <h3>Fruits Basket</h3>

      <p>After a family tragedy turns her life upside down, plucky high schooler Tohru Honda takes matters into her own hands and moves out...into a tent! Unfortunately for her, she pitches her new home on private land belonging to the mysterious Sohma clan, and it isn't long before the owners discover her secret.</p> 
      
      <p>But, as Tohru quickly finds out when the family offers to take her in, the Sohmas have a secret of their own--when touched by the opposite sex, they turn into the animals of the Chinese Zodiac! But this curse has a history of abuse, isolation, ostracization, fear, and pain behind it, which has caused much suffering and broken many Sohmas.</p> 
      
      <p>Despite this, Tohru may just be able to heal the Sohmas hearts and soothe their souls, and even break the curse once and for all.</p>

      <p>There are two versions of this show - the first one being made in 2001 and the second and more popular being made in 2019 - 2022. The first one ran for only 26 episodes whereas the second version ran for 4 seasons. There is also a prelude of everything that happened before the show, as well as a manga.</p>

      <p>They are available to stream on Crunchyroll, Funimation, and Hulu.</p>
